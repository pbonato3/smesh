# SMESH 
### Split Mesh library
***

A basic library to split and perform boolean operations between two meshes. 
It contains all the math to avoid dependecies.
Class types are simple and well separated to allow replacement with custom classes.

## Features
* Support triangular meshes only.
* Perform split, addition, subtraction and intersection.
* Merge points below a given tolerance to reduce small faces.
* No dependency at all.
* It seems to be fast, but it must be properly tested.
* C# .NET source.

## License
I haven't decided what to do with this piece of software yet, so for now it is available under GPL.

## Roadmap
* C++ source code
* Javascript source code
* Polygonal faces pre-triangulation
